Punjabi Wordsearch
==================

A wordsearch Dart application that generates wordsearches in both English and Punjabi. A demo can be found [here](https://www.gulshansingh.com/wordsearch/).

To add another language, simply create a class that extends WordPlacer, implement the required methods (should be straight forward after looking at the examples), and modify the switch statement in the WordPlacer factory constructor.
